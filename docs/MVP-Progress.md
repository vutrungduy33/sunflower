## Round 1: Admin Web Quality Baseline

- Date: 2026-06-02
- Status: completed
- Focus: make `sunflower-admin-web` lint, tests, and build pass without changing
  user-facing behavior.
- Start evidence:
  - `git status --short --untracked-files=all`: clean.
  - `npm run test`: passed, 20 tests.
  - `npm run lint`: failed on unused `_refundId` in
    `sunflower-admin-web/src/test/order-management-page.test.tsx`.
- Change summary:
  - Updated the `retryAdminRefund` test mock to return the refund record id it
    receives, removing the unused parameter while keeping the mock faithful to
    the admin order API.
- Open-source reference check:
  - Task classification: tiny repo-specific test lint fix.
  - Sources checked: not applicable; the active `open-source-reference-first`
    skill allows skipping research for obvious bug fixes.
  - Selected approach: use the existing mocked refund id in the returned order
    fixture so the test remains faithful to the API shape.
  - License/compatibility: no external code copied.
  - Reused/adapted: existing local test fixture pattern only.
  - Rejected options: adding lint suppressions or broad test refactors.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - `cd sunflower-admin-web && npm run lint`: passed.
  - `cd sunflower-admin-web && npm run test`: passed, 20 tests.
  - `cd sunflower-admin-web && npm run build`: passed.
  - `docs/Project-State.md` reflects the updated validation snapshot.
  - The round is committed once.
- Goal correction:
  - The prior admin-web test failures were not reproducible in this round; the
    current local evidence shows the admin-web suite passes after the lint fix.
- Next recommended round:
  - Create `docs/MVP-Readiness.md` and refresh stale handoff/API/deployment
    wording against the current architecture and validation evidence.
